# Professional Portfolio
***

## General Info
This is the first web application that I am writing from scratch for the Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to create a portfolio page, to which I will add as the course progresses.  The specifications that are required are:
* The page needs my name, a picture or avatar, and links to sections about my projects and how to contact me.
* Wen you click on the links in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the section with titled images of my projects.
* The first project image should be bigger than the others.
* When you click on the projects, you will be taken to the deployed appliation.
* The page has a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
